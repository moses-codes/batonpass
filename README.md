# Tech used
I implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for both front and back end (Node/Express), as well as Mongoose for the MongoDB Atlas database, and the templating language EJS to handle the client-side views. 

I used MVC (Model-view-controller) architecture for this app to organize the back-end.

#  Optimizations

Currently, BatonPass is an MVP to demonstrate functionality. In the future, users will be able to upload profile pictures, edit all profile information, and chat with each other.
