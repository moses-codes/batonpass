# Tech used
I implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for both front and back end (Node/Express), as well as Mongoose for the MongoDB database, and the templating language EJS to handle the client-side views. 

I used MVC (Model-view-controller) architecture and designed a REST API for the front-end and back-end to communicate.

# Install & Run

Type `npm install` into your terminal to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to run. You'll need a database connection to MongoDB Atlas.

# What you need

- Create a `.env` file in config folder and add the following as `key = value`
  - PORT (can be any port example: 3000)
  - DB_STRING = `your database URI`
